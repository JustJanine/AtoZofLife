Right so basically, all I want is to create an A to Z in wildlife for minecraft, however, I am needing help, I can model all day,
just cannot UV map. When I do try, there are either overlapping issues, or there are issues with how it gets coloured etc...
So if you want to UV map and join with me on this project, fill your boots, just please don't edit my models without credit!
BASICALLY IF YOU USE MY MODELS GIVE ME CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE, ITS COMMON CURTOSEY.

That is all, Thank you :D
